# BullCowUnreal
This is the WOP Unreal Engine 4 version of the BullCowGame from this Udemy Course:

NOTE:

You will need to install Unreal Engine 4.

Also, if the .uproject file asks to rebuild, click ok. This is not an error in the code. The Engine is simply rebuilding certain engine components in order to run the game.
